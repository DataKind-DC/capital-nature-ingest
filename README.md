# capital-nature-ingest
Webscraping nature-related events from a variety of sources to populate an events calendar on [Capital Nature](http://capitalnature.org/).

## What is Capital Nature?
Capital Nature is a 501c3 nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing nature into the lives of Washington Metro area residents and visitors. They want to highlight on an [events calendar](http://capitalnature.org/events/month/) all the great nature events and experiences happening in the area.

### How do we update the event calendar?
 - For each of the [event sources](https://github.com/DataKind-DC/capital-nature-ingest/blob/master/event_sources.md), we use Python (3.6.6) to scrape the events' data and transform it to fit our [schema](https://github.com/DataKind-DC/capital-nature-ingest/blob/master/event_schema.md).
 - To periodically deploy these Python scripts, we plan to use AWS Lambda.
 - To store our data, we plan to use AWS S3.
 - To track bugs, request new features, or just submit interesting ideas, we use GitHub [issues](https://github.com/DataKind-DC/capital-nature-ingest/issues).

## Getting Started
1. Assuming you've got Python 3.6 and a GitHub account, clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DataKind-DC/capital-nature-ingest.git
```

2. Navigate into the repository you just cloned:
```bash
cd capital-nature-ingest
```

3. Start a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>You can deactivate the virtual environment with:
```bash
deactivate
```

4. Get the events:
Before getting the events, you'll need to have a National Park Service API key. Get one [here](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm). Then, add it as an environment variable called `NPS_KEY` or simply input it when prompted by the following script:

```bash
python get_events.py
```

Running the above will scrape all of the events and output a csv into the root of the project.
